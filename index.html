During your click, you expand your lips to make the &quot;ahhh&quot; sound - again, without actually making the sound. In a sensem you are going, &quot;oooowah!&quot; in silence.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;2. Make a tongue clicking noise by pressing the tip of your tongue to the top of your mouth. Create a seal so that you are attempting to suck in air, but instead there is now pressure on your tongue because of the seal. Use the muscle of your tongue to release the pressure and produce the clicking noise.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;3.

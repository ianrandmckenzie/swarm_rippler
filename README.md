# Swarm Rippler

This is part of an project for supplementing my drawings with a more interactive experience. The basic premise is that there are 4 layers. The layers start on the inside and work their way outward. If there are multiple sounds in a layer, they happen simultaneously â€“ something most humans are not capable of, creating somewhat of an alien cacophony.

## Security

This project has been audited for security and implements multiple security measures:

- **Content Security Policy (CSP)**: Strict CSP prevents XSS attacks
- **HTTP Security Headers**: Additional headers prevent common web vulnerabilities
- **Minimal Permissions**: Tauri app uses only essential permissions
- **No External Dependencies**: App operates entirely offline
- **Regular Security Audits**: Dependencies are regularly scanned for vulnerabilities

For detailed security information, see [SECURITY.md](SECURITY.md).

To run a security check:
```bash
./security-check.sh
```

## Getting Started

### Web Version
Simply open `index.html` in your browser to use the web version.

### Desktop Application (Tauri)

#### Prerequisites
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (v16 or later)
- [Rust](https://rustup.rs/) (latest stable version)

#### Development
1. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

2. Start the development server:
   ```bash
   npm run tauri:dev
   ```

#### Building for Production
To create a native desktop application:
```bash
npm run tauri:build
```

This will create platform-specific installers in `src-tauri/target/release/bundle/`.

## The Grid

In a 2-layer system, the number 5 is "layer 0." 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 7, 8, 9 are "layer 1."

## How sounds are produced

### Center Layer

#### Number 5: The "Droplet" - Position: Absolute Center

To produce this noise with your mouth may take some practice. There are two simultaneous movements happening with your mouth:
1. Positioning your lips to make an "oooh" sound, without making the "oooh" sound. During your click, you expand your lips to make the "ahhh" sound - again, without actually making the sound. In a sensem you are going, "oooowah!" in silence.
2. Make a tongue clicking noise by pressing the tip of your tongue to the top of your mouth. Create a seal so that you are attempting to suck in air, but instead there is now pressure on your tongue because of the seal. Use the muscle of your tongue to release the pressure and produce the clicking noise.
3. Combining these two motions should produce a "droplet" sounding noise if done correctly.

### Outer Layers

#### Number 1, "oooh" left-click (top left)

Make a tongue clicking noise by pressing the tip of your tongue to the top of your mouth. Create a seal so that you are attempting to suck in air, but instead there is now pressure on your tongue because of the seal. Use the muscle of your tongue to release the pressure and produce the clicking noise. While doing this, your lips should be positioned as if you are making an "oooh" noise.

**Releasing the tongue:** For this click, you want to release the tongue from the left side, meaning when you use your muscles to release and make the clicking noise, you are pulling your tongue to the right.

#### Number 2, "oooh" click (grid:top middle)

Make a tongue clicking noise by pressing the tip of your tongue to the top of your mouth. Create a seal so that you are attempting to suck in air, but instead there is now pressure on your tongue because of the seal. Use the muscle of your tongue to release the pressure and produce the clicking noise. While doing this, your lips should be positioned as if you are making an "oooh" noise.

#### Number 3, plosive glottal stop (grid:top middle)

[Wikipedia explains a "glottal stop" better than I ever will.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glottal_stop)

Yes, I spelled "plosive" correctly.

"Plosive" refers to a stop consonant that is typically egressiveâ€”meaning air is pushed out from the lungs. It is a general term that includes sounds like [p], [t], [k], [b], [d], [g], where airflow is momentarily blocked and then released.

So, in contrast:

Explosive (not a technical linguistic term) implies a strong outward release.
Implosive involves inward airflow due to glottalic ingression. [Speaking of implosive, see: Number 7, implosive glottal stop (grid:top middle)](#number-7-implosive-glottal-stop-gridtop-middle)
Plosive is neutral regarding airflow direction but usually refers to egressive stops.

#### Number 4, snarl left click (grid: center left)

Make a tongue clicking noise by pressing the tip of your tongue to the top of your mouth. Create a seal so that you are attempting to suck in air, but instead there is now pressure on your tongue because of the seal. Use the muscle of your tongue to release the pressure and produce the clicking noise. While doing this, your lips should be positioned as if you are making an "eeeh" noise.

**Releasing the tongue:** For this click, you want to release the tongue from the left side, meaning when you use your muscles to release and make the clicking noise, you are pulling your tongue to the right.

#### Number 6, snarl right click (grid: center right)

Make a tongue clicking noise by pressing the tip of your tongue to the top of your mouth. Create a seal so that you are attempting to suck in air, but instead there is now pressure on your tongue because of the seal. Use the muscle of your tongue to release the pressure and produce the clicking noise. While doing this, your lips should be positioned as if you are making an "eeeh" noise.
